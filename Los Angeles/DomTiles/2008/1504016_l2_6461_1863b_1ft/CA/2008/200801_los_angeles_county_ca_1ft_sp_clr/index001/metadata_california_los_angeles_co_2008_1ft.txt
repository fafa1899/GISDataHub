  Description:
    Abstract: These files contain 1-foot GSD high-resolution orthorectified Color (RGB) aerial image map products in GeoTIFF format.  The LAR-IAC2 project encompasses the entire land area of Los Angeles County in mainland plus Catalina Island.  The County boundary in mainland was buffered by 500 feet. The 1-foot resolution digital orthoimagery was developed over forest area mainland covering approximately 1,056 square miles, and 0.33-foot resolution digital orthoimagery was developed over the Urban/Suburban mainland areas of the County covering approximately 2,898 square miles, and Catalina Island covering approximately 75 square miles.  This dataset is a consistent 1-foot resolution countywide comprised of the forested area coverage and a resampled version of the 0.33-foot urban imagery.
    Purpose: The digital ortho photos are produced to use it for various purposes such as Planimetric data capture, Emergency management, Land use or land cover, Economic development, Environment management, Wetlands management, etc.
    Supplemental_Information: Los Angeles County provided the digital elevation model (DEM) data for the purposes of orthorectification.

  Logical_Consistency_Report: The dataset contains raster images of digital orthophotos so the logical consistency report is not applicable.  The file naming convention of the 1-foot resolution, is based on a Basic Modular Unit. It measures 5,280 ft x 5,280 ft. based on the California State Plan Coordinate System, Zone V. The origin of the tile grid system was arbitrary. The neat image area is bounded by the state plane grid whose Easting and Northing are evenly divisible by 5,280 feet. For example, a tile with the lower left corner coordinates of E = 6,345,000 and N = 2,042,000 will be known as Tile Number L2_6345_2042. The first four digits represent the first four numbers of the East coordinates and the last four numbers represent the first four numbers of the North coordinates.  The L2 prefix designates the tile was produced for the LAR-IAC2 program.
  Completeness_Report: The digital orthoimagery has been inspected against the tile and project boundaries to ensure complete coverage.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Los Angeles County was divided into three major production areas for this project; urban/suburban area, forest area, and Catalina Island. Aerial imagery was collected in 2008.  The imagery was acquired utilizing Pictometry-owned digital camera systems. Ground control used to support the mapping was provided by LAR-IAC with additional locations collected at strategic locations on the aerial photography plan and then determining the coordinates by GPS ground survey techniques.  The Aerial Triangulation was performed using softcopy workstations.  Bundle adjustment was performed using standard photogrammetric collection techniques on softcopy workstations.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Existing Digital Elevation Models were updated where necessary to support the orthorectification process using softcopy workstations.  The images were then ortho rectified and color balanced.  Seamless mosaicing was performed and the seamless mosaic was clipped into tiles.
